# EvaDB_Customer_Churn_App

# Introduction:
The Customer Churn project is a combination of the power of data prediction models with a simple interface for people to interact with.  In our project, we want to give banks a prediction if a customer is going to stay with them, which we will define as churn. We used models like Ludwig, as the engine to create churn predictions from our CSV data, and streamlit to create our UI. We aimed to create an environment where potential users can find out the retention of bank customers, given some data about that particular customer.  This project has very strong utility, since banks can use powerful ML projects, such as QWERTY to determine customer satisfaction and retention rates.
